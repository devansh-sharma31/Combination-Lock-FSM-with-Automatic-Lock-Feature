# Combination-Lock-FSM-with-Automatic-Lock-Feature
This project implements an FSM-based combination lock in Verilog HDL. The system validates a predefined input sequence, generates an unlock signal for a fixed 30-second duration, and then automatically transitions back to the locked state. The design is fully synthesizable and suitable for FPGA implementation.
